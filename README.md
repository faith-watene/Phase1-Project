# Phase1-Project
# Project Overview
**For this project, we will use data cleaning , imputation, analysis and visualisation to generate
insights for a buisness stakeholder**

***Business Problem***
A company is looking into new industries to help diversify their portfolio. They are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises. Given they are unaware of the risks that come with this business, we will look into an aircraft with the lowest risks to ensure the business runs well. Our findings will be translated into information that will help the head of department make the right decisions.

# Data Understanding
The data we will use is from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes;
* Aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023
* Selected incidents in the United States and international waters

Below are the visualisations we got from analysing the data

From the above graphs, we have made the observation that the aircraft with the least makes encountered
most serious and fatal injuries.

# Conclusions and Observations.
**Observations:**
1. **Accident/Incident Pattern** Analyze data to identify recurring patterns or trends in aircraft accidents or incidents. Look for common factors such as weather conditions, pilot error and mechanical problems.
   
2. **Flight Schedule Analysis** Study flight schedules to identify peak air traffic times, busiest routes, and patterns that may cause congestion or delays.

3. **Aircraft Characteristics** Review data on aircraft type and characteristics. Identify trends in reliability, maintenance issues, or safety performance of different aircraft models.

4. **Safety Precautions** Review the safety precautions implemented by airlines and aviation authorities. Efficiency is evaluated based on accident/disaster rates before and after implementation.

5. **Compliance.** Assess compliance with aviation regulations and standards. Find out where compliance is lacking or where improvements can be made.

**Possible solutions:**
1. **Enhanced Training and Procedures:** Provides additional training to pilots and flight crews to address common causes of accidents or incidents. Implement standardized procedures to improve safety protocols.
   
2. **Improved Maintenance Protocols:** Implement more stringent maintenance schedules and procedures to ensure aircraft are properly maintained and operated safely.

3. **Technology Upgrades** Invest in technology upgrades to aircraft systems, air traffic control and safety equipment to improve overall safety and efficiency.

4. **Air Traffic Management Solutions** Develop strategies to manage air traffic flows more efficiently, including route optimization, airspace redesign, and improved communication systems.

5. **Regulatory Reform:** Advocate for regulatory reform to address identified safety issues and improve overall aviation safety standards.
